# Rollin' App

# Info

A POC app for BJJ academy reference.

Starting out with a basic map view pulling in some test data from a local JSON file. The dataset will eventually reflect actual BJJ schools - starting in the US and expanding into other locales.

The map makes use of Leaflet, which relies on a GeoJSON data format.

Eventually, data should be sourced via a dedicated API service. This is another work in progress project.
Other features and functionality will continue to be added.

# Use

`npm run dev` and we're off.
